![NBA Shot Chart 14-15](http://i.imgur.com/kBFjbUB.png)

I chose to visually encode the NBA player shot data the way I did because it helps the user understand the data from a contextual standpoint. It uses location on a two-dimensional surface to show where the player shot from. I purposely didn't add any axis because I felt that they don't convey any actual meaning. The data had location (x,y) of the shot taken respective to the basket but basketball isn't a sport where people look at the x and the y to determine where the player shot from, they just look at the court. The (x,y) coordinates are only for plotting purposes. That being said, distance from the basket IS a statistic that people look at so I decided to encode that through a mousehover tooltip. I wanted to show the shots made/missed so I made them different colors. I chose yellow/red tones because they're both easy to see and distinguish from each other. I also purposely extended the height of the svg/g elements beyond that of the court to show some of the "crazy" shots some of these players have taken. Some disadvantages of this method is that it doesn't show the number of shots and it's not entirely clear how effective a shooter might be in different areas. The chart also has overlapping data so datapoints are potentially lost to the viewer.

The first control feature I had was the ability to choose different players. I think this is very important because people often like comparing NBA players to others and now they can, visually. The chart allows the user to look at the amount of shots taken and where they took them. Although there aren't actual number of shots/makes/misses, I think the chart suffices in answering simple questions such as "what areas on the court does X miss the most?" I would have liked to have a dropdown menu with more than just three players, but I had trouble in retreiving the data from the site in the JSON format that I liked. One finding is that Curry seems to effectively shoot three pointers all around the arc, where James misses in some areas or avoids them altogether. Another finding is the much fewer amount of shots Bryant took in the 2014-15 season which was because he played much fewer games than Curry/James due to injury.

The second control feature I created was the ability to filter by the quarters. I had options (All, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th) so users can answer questions such as "does a player's shooting trends differ by quarter?" A simple look at this can be seen with Steph Curry. He seems to shoot a lot more threes in the first and third quarter. We see a fewer number of shots in the fourth quarter and this is most likely due to Curry not playing in a lot of fourth quarters. Also, Curry is probably more likely to shoot threes in the first quarter because there is "less risk" if he misses as opposed to the late game.
